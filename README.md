# R43 Pro/ m18 Better congig's
This repository is to help create a better user experience for the R43 Pro/ m18 verital handheld.  While this may not be what you are looking for in a proper custom firmware It is aimed at getting the most out of the stock SD image for these devices.
# Stock SD Notice
It is hightly recommended to both backup your sd card image and replace the stock sd card image with reputablely branded sd cards.
# How to install
Copy both the retroarcha and .emulationstation folders to the root of the SD card and allow it to overwrite teh existing files for the changes to take effect.
#Changing Themes
This package includes several alternative themes. To change a theme, go to /.emulationstation/themes/ and delete the M18 folder. Go into any of the folders in the /themes/ directory and copy the M18 folder that you find. Paste that folder to /.emulationstation/themes/. You can find additional themes online and extract them to this folder. Rename them to M18 if you want to use them. This is janky, but it's the easiest way.  NOTE:  Highly recommend making a backup of this folder so that it can be reset to the Original theme
